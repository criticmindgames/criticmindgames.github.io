**Criticmind Games** is the dedicated game development division of [Criticmind Inc](https://criticmind.com), focused on creating casual, logic-driven, and mind-sharpening experiences.  
We believe that games can be both entertaining and enriching, offering players moments of fun while stimulating creativity, memory, and problem-solving skills.

Our team explores simple, elegant mechanics that are easy to learn but rewarding to master. Whether it’s a quick puzzle, a strategic challenge, or a relaxing brain teaser, each project is crafted with care and attention to detail.

This website serves as a living gallery of what we build.  
At [criticmind.games](https://criticmind.games), you’ll find:

- **Mini-games** designed for short, engaging play sessions  
- **Logic puzzles and brain challenges** for players who enjoy thinking outside the box  
- **Experimental prototypes**, where we test new ideas, mechanics, and interactive concepts  
- **Early releases** that evolve over time as we refine and improve them

Criticmind Games is inspired by the joy of discovery — the feeling of solving a tricky puzzle or unlocking a new insight.  
Our goal is to bring that feeling to players around the world, one small game at a time.

Thank you for exploring our universe of logic and creativity.  
We hope our games become a part of your daily inspiration, offering moments of clarity, challenge, and play.
